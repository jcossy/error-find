# Error Find App
App for Cambridge University Press, designed to help students that want to learn English. 

The app presents the student with a series of questions, each of which is in a correct or incorrect format. The student is presented with a round or rounds of questions. Each question in a round contains a sentence, with a highlighted section, 
that may or may not be correct. The student has to decide whether the sentence is correct. After a round is completed the results are displayed. 

## How to use.
When the app starts up, a series of activity buttons are displayed. The student can access an activity (round of questions) if the 
relevant activity button is highlighted. 

Simply click on an active activity button and start answering the questions!

## Live App
A working version of the app may be found at https://jcossy.github.io/error-find/
